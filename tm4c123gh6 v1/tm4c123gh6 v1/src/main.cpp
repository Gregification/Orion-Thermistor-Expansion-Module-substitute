/* heres a quote from Tim (Tim Stevens) original work.       
 *      "
 *      This code works. Its ghetto, but the BMS is happy with it. had to add that 57 for some weird reason. IDK
 *      Checksum is CRITICAL to getting BMS not to fault.
 * 
 *      This is specific to the 40x Temp Sensing Module made fr E17.
 * 
 *      Despite some of the terrible programming, the program cycles very fast, usually a bit less than a millisecond. Meaning all temps are checked in 8ms or less.
 *      "
 * you should note that the first paragraph is wrong (he should have read the data sheet more closely),
 *      while on the last paragraph is true for his work.
 * this code is better (allegedly by me)
